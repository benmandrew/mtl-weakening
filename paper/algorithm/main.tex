\section{Algorithm for Interval Weakening}\label{sec:algorithm}

\cegiw{} is split into two levels. First, there is a function \textit{weaken} (\cref{alg:aux}) that, given an \MTL{} formula $\phi$, an interval $I$ in $\phi$ to weaken, and a counterexample trace $\pi$, weakens $I$ such that the new formula $\phi'$ holds on $\pi$ (\cref{subsec:cex-relative-weakening}). However, this does not guarantee that $\phi'$ holds on the model itself, and so we need to repeat the process, finding a new counterexample trace for $\phi'$ and weakening the interval again. The second part of \cegiw{} is this iterative process that finds counterexample traces by model checking (\cref{subsec:iterative-weakening}).
