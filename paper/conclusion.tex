\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We present \cegiw{}, a novel algorithm for weakening intervals in \MTL{} properties of degraded systems, and prove its correctness and optimality. We demonstrate how \cegiw{} can be used during the design phase to understand system limitations under degradation, and explore how the formalised requirements of a number of real-world systems may be weakened against real implementations. This shows the applicability of \cegiw{} in the design of safety-critical systems for understanding the impacts of system degradation.

\textbf{Future work.}
A current limitation is that we only weaken on the right-hand-side of intervals, when both left- and right-bound modifications can produce valid weakenings. Restricting to only right-bound modifications creates a total order over the search space, so there is always a single optimum when multiple choices exist. Expanding to both left- and right-bound modifications creates a partial order over generated intervals, and so choosing between intervals is much less obvious.

% Future work will also explore other types of weakening, making syntactic changes beyond intervals.
